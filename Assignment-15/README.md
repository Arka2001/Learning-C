### Assignment 15

* Create an `int` variable.
* Create a pointer to the `int variable

Use the following variable references to replace the `x` in the appropriate print statements below.

* `*ptr`
* `variable`
* `ptr`
* `&variable`

Print statements: -

* `printf("The value of int variable is: %d\n", x);`
* `printf("The value of the pointer to the int variable is: %d\n", x);`
* `printf("The memory address of the int variable is: %d\n", x);`
* `printf("The value held at the memory location that the pointer is pointing to is: %d\n", x);`


Hint: Google and read about pointers

Extra Credit: There's more than one set of correct answers! Find a different way to get the same output.
