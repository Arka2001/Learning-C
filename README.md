## Learning C
<hr>

This repo is a collection of assignments and mini-programs/projects for beginners trying to learn C. Try to complete each task without looking at the solution! I am not a programmer by any means and a lot of this code will be trash. None of this is meant to be comprehensive or an alternative to hard work, enjoy!

I have not forked the original repository, [Click Here](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C), or from [whokilleddb](https://github.com/whokilleddb)'s repository, [Click Here](https://github.com/whokilleddb/Learning-C). But the assignments and programs are the same. You can either fork this repo or theirs, but enjoy the learning curve!
