### Assignment 10

Create an integer array with 10 integers and then print the number of elements in the array to the terminal.

I will do a little extra, I shall dynamically allocate the memory in the heap and then print all the elements to the terminal, along with the total number of elements present in the array.

Hint: Play with the `sizeof()` function to determine how many bytes of storage an integer takes up.
